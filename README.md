## Overview
Judicial Automation is the primary need of Courts today which are overloaded with Cases and need a tool to Automate their working. 

Over 3 crore cases are pending in the courts. Shocking huh...Imagine the number of cases that have already gone by.Total number of judges as per report are 17000. Just by dividing the figures one can get the idea of the burden of court cases on the judges and on the system. The court proceedings are documented for official records, references and study. But does somebody want to go through millions of records just to find A FILE. I think this is where we come into the picture. How about designing a database which could manage all of the workload. But what's included…

1) lawyer database and their win/loss ratio,their field of study

2) A judge pending case history

3) Current cases history
 
4) Police Officer appointment and duty to the case

5) List and link of important records related to case

The database will ensure that the document access is restricted well within the abiding laws and access will be given to the required statutory of the government.

## Relevance:

1) It can help automate legal departments of large corporations as well as create strong countrywide e-justice networks.

2) This enables the people living in remote areas to fight for their rights and choose a suitable lawyer

3) One can choose the layer according to win/loss ratio and that the lawyer’s degree are justified and legal

4) People can upload and submit the documents when asked from them by the court even in the post covid times

5) Such apps can be used to tackle  small magistrate cases from home and itself as the database of the case could be maintained at dispense on a web page and cases could be fought by the lawyers in presence of a judge over video call conference.

## NOVELTY

The existing solution comprises of :

Wolter Kluwer

TheLawAssist.com,

Clio

MyCase

Ebizframe Justice

All of these previously mentioned apps are centric around the following features:

Case Management

Document Management

Task Management

We are intuitively planning to maintain a lawyer database with their details and win/loss ratio with an authentication factor/bar council number.

This will be the first portal which will prove to be a complete interface for all the judicial and customary activities
